# My researcher website

This project corresponds to my personal researcher website. All the source code used for the development of the website is inside this project. The website has been developed with Hugo (making use of the [Hugo Academic Resum√© Template](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/)) and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
