Fault detection and diagnosis in bearings is important in predictive maintenance tasks. However, performing it is not trivial. This webpage provides open-source tools so everyone can use it to detect faults in bearings. Monotonic Smoothed Stacked AutoEncoder is integrated in order to remove human intervention in feature extraction, as features are extracted automatically.
