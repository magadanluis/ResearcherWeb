I am a PhD candidate in the Self-management of IT systems Lab in the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Oviedo. My research interests are related with the Industrial Internet of Things, specially with the development of low-cost prototypes oriented to health prognostics of electric motors. I have developed a low-cost vibration monitoring system and a meter monitoring system, both currently installed in different industrial plants. I am a lecturer in the area of Computer Architecture and Technology at the University of Oviedo.
